### Detailed Breakdown of Files

#### auth.py

Handles Instagram authentication and session management:

1. **Decryption of Credentials**:
   - Decrypts stored Instagram credentials using a generated key.
   
2. **Login Management**:
   - Manages login sessions, checking for an active session first and creating a new one if necessary.

2. **Encrypting Credentials**:
   - Encrypts the Instagram username and password using the generated key.
   
3. **Getting User Inputs**:
   - Prompts the user for various configuration details such as profiles to scrape, number of reels, and intervals.
